# First Person Singular Pronoun Analysis
![Alt text](./docs/shields/Python-3.6-blue.svg)

First singular person pronouns have a relevant scientific importance as indicators of depression, anxiety and mental disease. This consideration is discussed over several works, providing how psychologists converged on the same idea that self-focused is a problem related with depression.

Such a problem can be explored with linguistic analysis, evaluating how much frequently people talk about themselves. Therefore, the attention moves into linguistic indicators able to prove the above mentioned problem, such as the first person singular pronouns *I*, *me*, *my* and *mine*.

That framework aims to provide a tool for computing the first person singular pronouns frequency in a pool of samples.

The project is part of the scientific research carried out at [University of Messina](https://www.unime.it/en) and it aims to be a research product.
